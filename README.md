# Arduino Maze Game:

The Arduino Maze game is an engaging game which allows individuals to practice and develop
their fine motor skills in an entertaining manner. The inspiration of making this project was to
create a product which would assist patients in their development/rehabilitation of fine motor
skills. The applications of creating this product is one which allows patients of all demographics
to utilize this game for their well-being. For example healthcare providers are able to use the
principles of my game in order to test patients fine motor skills over time and use it for analysis
and diagnosis purposes of coordination affected disorders such as Parkinson's Disease. Overall, the
Arduino Maze game can be used both in a fun manner to test your skills and for training of fine
motor skills.
